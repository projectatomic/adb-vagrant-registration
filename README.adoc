The vagrant-registration plugin for Vagrant allows developers to easily
register their guests for updates on systems with a subscription model
(like Red Hat Enterprise Linux).

This plugin would run _register_ action on `vagrant up` before any
provisioning and _unregister_ on `vagrant halt` or `vagrant destroy`.
The actions then call the registration capabilities that have to be
provided for the given OS.

== Installation

Install vagrant-registration as any other Vagrant plugin:

[source,shell]
----
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-registration
----

If you are on Fedora, you can install the packaged version of the plugin
by running:

[source,shell]
----
# dnf install vagrant-registration
----

== Usage

The plugin is designed in a registration-manager agnostic way, which
means, that the plugin itself, depends neither on any OS nor on the way
of registration. The vagrant-registration plugin only calls registration
capabilities for the given guest, passes the configuration options to
them and handles interactive registration.

That being said, this plugin currently ships only with registration
capability files for RHEL's Subscription Manager and `rhn_register`.
Feel free to submit others.

To configure the plugin, always include the configuration options
mentioned in this file within the following configuration block in your
Vagrantfile.

....
Vagrant.configure('2') do |config|
  ...
end
....

=== General Configuration

* *skip* skips the registration. If you wish to skip the registration
process altogether, you can do so by setting a `skip` option to `true`:

[source,ruby]
----
  config.registration.skip = true
----

* *unregister_on_halt* disables or enables automatic unregistration on
halt (on shut down). By default the plugin unregisters on halt, you can
however change that by setting the option to `false` so that the box
will unregister only on destroy:

[source,ruby]
----
  config.registration.unregister_on_halt = false
----

* *manager* selects the registration manager provider. By default the
plugin will use the `subscription_manager` as the registration manager
provider. You can however, change that by setting the option to a
different manager:

[source,ruby]
----
  config.registration.manager = 'subscription_manager'
----

=== Credential Configuration

You can set up the credentials as follows:

[source,ruby]
----
Vagrant.configure('2') do |config|
  ...
  if Vagrant.has_plugin?('vagrant-registration')
    config.registration.username = 'foo'
    config.registration.password = 'bar'
  end

  # Alternatively
  if Vagrant.has_plugin?('vagrant-registration')
    config.registration.org = 'foo'
    config.registration.activationkey = 'bar'
  end
  ...
end
----

This should go, preferably, into the Vagrantfile in your Vagrant home
directory (defaults to ~/.vagrant.d), to make it available for every
project. It can be later overridden in an individual project's
Vagrantfile if needed.

If you prefer not to store your username and/or password on your
filesystem, you can optionally configure vagrant-registration plugin to
use environment variables such as:

[source,ruby]
----
Vagrant.configure('2') do |config|
  ...
  config.registration.username = ENV['SUB_USERNAME']
  config.registration.password = ENV['SUB_PASSWORD']
  ...
end
----

If you do not configure your credentials as outlined above, you will
receive a maximum of 3 prompts for them during the `vagrant up` process.

Please note that the interactive mode asks you for the preferred
registration pair only for the configured manager.

=== HTTP Proxy Configuration

HTTP Proxy can be configured via the __proxy__, _proxyUser_ and
_proxyPassword_ configuration options:

[source,ruby]
----
Vagrant.configure('2') do |config|
  ...
  if Vagrant.has_plugin?('vagrant-registration')
    config.registration.proxy = 'mongo:8080'
    config.registration.proxyUser = 'flash'
    config.registration.proxyPassword = 'zarkov'
  end
  ...
end
----

As described in the link:#credentials-configuration[credentials
configuration] section, these settings can be placed either into the
Vagrantfile in the Vagrant home directory or provided as environment
variables.

=== subscription-manager Configuration

The vagrant-registration plugin uses `subscription_manager` as the
default manager. This can also be explicitly configured by setting the
`manager` option to `subscription_manager`:

[source,ruby]
----
Vagrant.configure('2') do |config|
  ...
  if Vagrant.has_plugin?('vagrant-registration')
    config.registration.manager = 'subscription_manager'
  end
  ...
end
----

In case you choose `subscription_manager` as the manager, you would be
asked for your user credentials, such as the username and password.

The vagrant-registration plugin supports all the options for the
subscription-manager's register command. You can set any option easily
by setting `config.registration.OPTION_NAME = 'OPTION_VALUE'` in your
Vagrantfile (please see the subscription-manager's documentation for
option description).

==== subscription-manager Default Options

* **--force**: Subscription Manager will fail if you attempt to register
an already registered machine (see the man page for explanation),
therefore vagrant-registration appends the `--force` flag automatically
when subscribing. If you would like to disable this feature, set `force`
option to `false`:

[source,ruby]
----
  config.registration.force = false
----

* **--auto-attach**: Vagrant would fail to install packages on
registered RHEL system if the subscription is not attached, therefore
vagrant-registration appends the `--auto-attach` flag automatically when
subscribing. To disable this option, set `auto_attach` option to
`false`:

[source,ruby]
----
  config.registration.auto_attach = false
----

Note that the `auto_attach` option is set to false when using
org/activationkey for registration or if pools are specified.

==== subscription-manager Options Reference

[source,ruby]
----
  # The username to subscribe with (required)
  config.registration.username

  # The password of the subscriber (required)
  config.registration.password

  # Give the hostname of the subscription service to use (required for Subscription
  # Asset Manager, defaults to Customer Portal Subscription Management)
  config.registration.serverurl

  # A path to a CA certificate, this file would be copied to /etc/rhsm/ca and
  # if the file does not have .pem extension, it will be automatically added
  config.registration.ca_cert

  # Give the hostname of the content delivery server to use to receive updates
  # (required for Satellite 6)
  config.registration.baseurl

  # Give the organization to which to join the system (required, except for

----

=== rhn-register Configuration

vagrant-registration will use the `rhn_register` manager only if
explicitly configured by setting the `manager` option to `rhn_register`:

[source,ruby]
----
Vagrant.configure('2') do |config|
  ...
  if Vagrant.has_plugin?('vagrant-registration')
    config.registration.manager = 'rhn_register'
  end
  ...
end
----

In case of a `rhn_register` manager, the preferred registration pair is
the username/password/serverurl combination.

vagrant-registration supports most of the options of rhnreg_ks's
command. You can set any option easily by setting
`config.registration.OPTION_NAME = 'OPTION_VALUE'` in your Vagrantfile
(please see the `rhnreg_ks`'s documentation for option description).

`rhn_register` manager reuses the naming of `subscription-manager`'s
command options where possible.

==== rhn-register Default Options

* **--force**: `rhnreg_ks` command will fail if you attempt to register
an already registered machine (see the man page for explanation),
therefore vagrant-registration appends the `--force` flag automatically
when subscribing. If you would like to disable this feature, set `force`
option to `false`:

[source,ruby]
----
  config.registration.force = false
----

==== rhn-register Options Reference

  # The password associated with the username specified with the `--username` option.
  # This is an unencrypted password.
  config.registration.password

  # Give the URL of the subscription service to use (required for registering a
  # system with the "Spacewalk Server", "Red Hat Satellite" or "Red Hat Network Classic").

  # and the configuration  in `/etc/sysconfig/rhn/up2date` is updated to:
  # `sslCACert=/usr/share/rhn/<ca_file_name>`
  #
  # As default only the configuration in `/etc/sysconfig/rhn/up2date` is updated
  # to point to the CA certificate file that is present on Fedora, CentOS and RHEL:

== Development

The use of https://rvm.io[RVM] is recommended. Verified to work with ruby-2.2.10.

....
rvm install 2.2
rvm use 2.2
....

To install a development environment, clone the repo and prepare
dependencies by:

....
gem install bundler
bundle install
....

=== Tests

==== Minitest

The source contains a set of
http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.0.0/libdoc/minitest/rdoc/MiniTest.html[Minitest]
based unit tests. They can be run via:

....
$ bundle exec rake test
....

==== Acceptance tests

The source also contains a set of https://cucumber.io/[Cucumber] based
acceptance tests. They can be run via:

....
$ bundle exec rake features
....

The tests assume that the CDK box files are available under
__build/boxes/cdk-<provider>.box__. You can either copy the box files
manually or use the _get_cdk_ rake task to download them.

As per default, only the scenarios for CDK in combination with
VirtualBox are run. You can also run the tests against Libvirt, using
the environment variable __PROVIDER__:

....
# Run tests against Libvirt
$ bundle exec rake features PROVIDER=libvirt

# Run against VirtualBox and Libvirt
$ bundle exec rake features PROVIDER=virtualbox,libvirt
....

You can also run a single feature specifying the explicit feature file
to use:

....
$ bundle exec rake features FEATURE=features/<feature-filename>.feature
....

After test execution the acceptance test reports can be found under
__build/features_report.html__. They can also be opened via:

....
$ bundle exec rake features:open_report
....

== Releasing

To release a new version of vagrant-registration you will need to do the following:

*(only contributors of the GitHub repo and owners of the project at RubyGems will have rights to do this)*

1. First, bump, commit, and push the version in ~/lib/vagrant-registration/version.rb:
    * Follow [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).
2. Then, create a matching GitHub Release (this will also create a tag):
    * Preface the version number with a `v`.
    * https://github.com/projectatomic/adb-vagrant-registration/releases
3. You will then need to build and push the new gem to RubyGems:
    * `rake build`
    * `gem push pkg/vagrant-registration-1.3.2.gem`
4. Then, when John Doe runs the following, they will receive the updated vagrant-registration plugin:
    * `vagrant plugin update`
    * `vagrant plugin update vagrant-registration`
